# FPV @ PH
## A simple guideline for FPV quadcopter / drone pilots

### Introduction
If you arrived here, someone probably told you about 

### Flight Times
- Noise from motors can travel quite far. Be sensisble when choosing times to fly such that it doesnt disturb the residents. 
- Preferabally no flights before 8:30 a.m. or after 7 p.m. 
- Respect prayer times and land your aircarft. 

### Location / Gates 
- Fly only within the big field area. 
- Do not fly in the playground facing the residentials 
- Dont go to close to the apartments on the right
- If you are first to arrive, open up the gates and tie them neatly
- If you are last to leave, pull back all the gates
- If you crash into a gate, try to fix it. 
- If you cant fix it, pack the gates, remove broken pieces and store them at the side neatly

### Trash management
- Trash bags are available in the nearby silver car.  
- Please collect all the trash especially broken prop in the area and throw them in the blue cans accross the road
- Do not leave trash bags by the road. 

### Crowd and Noise Control
- Be sensible and logical. Not too loud music and not too much noise until it disturbes. Self judge the situation. Residents are probably trying to have a quite weekend at home
- Do not block the road by any means. Residents use the road to drop off recyclable items. 
- Number of people around? For now let's say 20 is too huge of a crowd. Re-schedule or re-time your flight to avoid attention
